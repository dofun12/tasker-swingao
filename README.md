# Tasker Swingao

## How to Execute the JAR

To execute the JAR file located in the `release` folder, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Java 21 installed**:
   - You can download and install Java 21 from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) or use a package manager suitable for your operating system.

2. **Navigate to the `release` folder**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Change the directory to the `release` folder where the JAR file is located. For example:
     ```sh
     cd path/to/release
     ```

3. **Run the JAR file**:
   - Use the following command to execute the JAR file:
     ```sh
     java -jar tasker-swingao-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
     ```

Make sure to replace `tasker-swingao-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` with the actual name of your JAR file if it differs.
